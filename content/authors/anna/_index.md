I am a postdoctoral research and teaching fellow. Currently my research focuses on using satellite imagery to map and characterize wildfire in northeastern Siberia. I have taught satellite image analysis and introduction to GIS. I am excited to work with undergratuate students that are interested in using satellite imagery to ask nd answer spatial temporal research questions. In my free time I can be found outside running, hiking, biking, outside time is the best time.
