British Columbian lodgepole pine forests have been the epicenter of the recent regional mountain pine beetle outbreak raising concern that altered fuel profiles could modify fire severity and ecological effects for these landscapes. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, three fires burned through high mortality, gray-phase lodgepole pine dominated forests in the plateau regions of central interior British Columbia, Canada, providing opportunity to test for interactions between beetle outbreak and wildfire in this more northern setting. We inventoried 63 plots that spanned gradients of outbreak severity, fire severity, and burning conditions. Our objective was to determine the effects of beetle outbreak severity on fire severity through various measures of fire effects that included nuanced assessments of biomass loss. We found that biomass loss in the form of consumed branch structure and deep char development had higher probabilities and great odds of occurrence on a beetle-killed snag compared to a fire-killed tree during wildfire. Typical fire effects â€“ scorch height and coverage, surface char, duff depth, exposed mineral soil, and remaining litter were unrelated to beetle outbreak severity. We estimated ~70% prefire mortality and ~93% cumulative mortality for lodgepole pine. The greater odds of biomass consumption on a beetle-killed snag versus a fire-killed tree suggests an important relationship for overlapping disturbances that alters the functional and structural attributes of the postfire landscape.
