Abstract: Bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires are two of the most prevalent disturbances in North American forests that influence tree mortality, regeneration, and successional trajectories. Contemporary forests are experiencing overlaps in these disturbances, where wildfires are burning through landscapes with substantial tree mortality from outbreaks. It is unclear how tree mortality from outbreaks influence burn severity in sub-boreal forests. We generated spatial data from Landsat imagery for three fires that burned in 2012, 2013, and 2014 across central interior British Columbia, Canada. We characterized outbreak severity conditions, prefire vegetation conditions, and subsequent burn severity as measured with spectral indices. We then evaluated drivers of moderate-high burn severity with boosted regression tree statistical modeling. We created separate models for ‘moderate’ and ‘extreme’ fire weather to assess the factors driving burn severity under different fire weather conditions. Landsat-based spectral indices of outbreak severity and prefire vegetation conditions indicated gradients of forest structure and composition associated with dead/sparse, mixed live and dead, and live/dense forest vegetation. Burned areas were dominated by moderate-high burn severity, indicating that much of the landscape still burns at moderate-high severity even with substantial prefire mortality. Fire weather was the most influential driver of the probability of moderate-high burn severity under extreme fire weather conditions, whereas prefire vegetation conditions were more influential under moderate fire weather conditions. While fire weather and drier climate conditions associated with these fire years are important drivers in these large infrequent fire systems, our analyses indicate the underlying prefire vegetation conditions created by bark beetle outbreaks were influential even with a 10-year lag between disturbance events. Quantifying the drivers of burn severity in forest systems that experience substantial tree mortality prior to wildfires will help improve understanding of how these disturbance interactions may play out under future climate scenarios.
